Welcome!
======

I’m **Jessica Persano**, a Predoctoral Research Fellow at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. I work with Professor Andrew Hall on projects that use large-scale datasets to study American politics and political economy:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  

Before coming to Stanford, I graduated **summa cum laude** from UCLA with a B.A. in Political Science (Honors) and a B.A. in Geography/Environmental Studies:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. My honors thesis, *The Determinants of Policy Representation: Evaluating the Role of Policy Type in the U.S. States*, examined how policy type and political salience shape democratic responsiveness. I also worked as a research assistant for Professor Daniel Thompson on local election administration, contributing to a published study in *PNAS* on private election funding and partisan outcomes:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  

Alongside my research in political science, I collaborated on projects in public health at UCLA’s Fielding School of Public Health, where I investigated barriers to post-assault care and accessibility of resources for students with disabilities:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  

My broader **research interests** include election administration, political representation, public policy, and data science:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. I am especially interested in how institutions shape democratic responsiveness and in applying rigorous quantitative methods to questions of representation and policy outcomes. I hope to pursue a Ph.D. in political science and build a career in academia, dedicating my life to teaching and research.
